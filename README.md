# frontal_3-category_face-mask_detection

Initially, custom and Kaggle datasets of correctly, improperly, and erroneouslyÂ donned masks of 9.5k human images were selected and trained using transfer learning via Mobile Net V2. 
With haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml, we first detect the frontal face area in real time, and then the model effortlessly recognizes the categories of face mask detection in humans,
reaching up to a 98 percent score on train data and up to 95 to 96 percent validation score if more epochs are continued.
In F1 score the precision rate was above 90 percent and in average was 95.
Hence utilizing cv2, sequential, transfer learning and mobilenet v2 with some minor data augmentation the model perform precisly in real time. Thus the project was fruitful.
